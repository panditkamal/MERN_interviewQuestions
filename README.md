1. ### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

   There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:

   1. **Object literal syntax:**

      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
           name: "Sudheer",
           age: 34
      };
      ```

      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
